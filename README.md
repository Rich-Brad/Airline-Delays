# Airline-Delays
My understanding of the dataset is the airline delays for December 2019 and 2020 for airline per carrier per US city. The data considers carrier, carrier name, airports, arrivals, and delays of several categories. Such as flight delays due to the National Aviation System, i.e. heavy air traffic, flight delays due to no crew, and delays in flights because a previous flight for the same plane was late.

A choropleth map was created to analyze research questions, for example, which airport cities have the most arriving flights and does the analysis lead to any new research questions?

Finally, time-series data analysis was conducted using data from Data.gov.  
Source, Original Data\MVA_Vehicle_Sales_Counts_by_Month_for_Calendar_Year_2002_through_December_2023.csv
The data set I chose is dealing with customer connection and the number of new and used vehicle sales by month, which occurred in the state of Maryland. I focused on total new vehicle sales each month from years 2002 to 2023.
